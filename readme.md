# **TOSD: Website project**
## About
**THIS IS A WIP**
My goal is to make a website that can onlt be accessed via a direct link in the form of a QR code.
This website will house information about me and my fianc√©e's wedding. 

To protect our privacy, and our database, I have taken measures in order to only allow verified users with the proper ids and tokens to access anything that
I consider private, such as the date and location of the wedding, our contact information, and the ability to RSVP.

You need application setting, secrets, and secret images in order to properly run this code. These are not available on github, but must be acquired from the owner (me).
If you wish to set this site up locally yourself you will need to add your own database and your own setting, secrets and images.

## How to run
mvn spring-boot:run
