# **TOSD: Website project**
## About
**THIS IS A WIP**

My goal is to make a website that can only be accessed via a direct link in the form of a QR code.
This website will house information about me and my fianc√©e's upcomming wedding and allow guests to RSVP. 

To protect our privacy, I have taken measures in order to only allow verified users with the proper ids and tokens to access anything that
I consider private, such as the date and location of the wedding, our contact information, and the ability to RSVP.

You need application setting, secrets, and secret images in order to properly run this code. These are not available on github, but must be acquired from the owner (me).
If you wish to set this site up locally yourself you will need to add your own database and your own settings, secrets and images. You will also need to set up the proper dependancies.

## How to run
1. start SQL server.
2. mvn spring-boot:run
